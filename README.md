# Train Schedule Application

I created a train schedule site/program that allows a user to enter information about the schedule for a train station.  By filling out the form and clicking "Add Row," the user can enter the name of the train, its destination, the exact time the first train will arrive that day, and how often it will arrive after that.  

To try this app yourself, click on the following link:
